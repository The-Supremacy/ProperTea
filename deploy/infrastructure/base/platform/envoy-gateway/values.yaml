# Envoy Gateway Helm values — base (all environments).
#
# Envoy Gateway ships with sensible defaults:
#   - Creates a GatewayClass named 'envoy'
#   - Deploys the controller into the 'envoy-gateway-system' namespace
#   - Spawns Envoy proxy pods in the same namespace as each Gateway resource
#
# HTTPRoutes reference the Gateway by name/namespace only (no gatewayClassName
# coupling), so they need no changes when switching from Cilium Gateway.
#
# On AKS: the CiliumLoadBalancerIPPool and CiliumL2AnnouncementPolicy are
# local-only (see deploy/environments/local/platform/gateway/cilium-l2.yaml).
# Azure Load Balancer fulfils the LoadBalancer Service IP automatically.
