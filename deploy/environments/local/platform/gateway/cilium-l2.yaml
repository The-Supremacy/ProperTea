# Local-only: Cilium L2 load balancer configuration.
#
# On AKS, Azure Load Balancer handles external IP assignment automatically when
# a LoadBalancer Service is created. These resources have no AKS equivalent
# and must not appear in AKS environment manifests.
#
# Locally, Cilium's L2 announcements ARP-advertise the LoadBalancer IP
# (192.168.50.200) on ens3 so the KVM host can route traffic into the cluster.
# Envoy Gateway requests a LoadBalancer Service; Cilium satisfies it from this pool.
