## AI Agents guidelines

### General guidelines

- IMPORTANT!!!! Don't make any code changes yourself and don't try to execute any commands. Just guide me and I'll do them myself.
- But you can make changes in documentation (*.md files).
- You are automatically allowed to read external documentation.
- When talking about new complex subjects, always provide context and explanations, not just the code.
- When suggesting code changes, always provide the full file content with your changes included.

### AI Agents guidelines for FE

- Use file 'llm/primeng.txt' as reference for PrimeNG usage.
