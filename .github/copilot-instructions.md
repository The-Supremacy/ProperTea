# General
- This is a .NET Aspire monorepo. The Source of Truth for Models is in /shared/contracts.
- We use a BFF pattern. Do not put business logic in the BFF; it is a pass-through/mapper only.
- Frontend is Next.js/Angular. Use Tailwind for styling.

# Documentation
- Do not create XML documentation for C# code members unless they describe something very specific (no 'Creates a user').
- No emojis.
