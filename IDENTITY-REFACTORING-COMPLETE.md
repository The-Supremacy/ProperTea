# ✅ Identity Service Refactoring - Complete

**Date:** November 5, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 1a Complete - Identity Service Refactored with Outbox Pattern

---

## 🎯 What We Accomplished

### ✅ Created Identity Worker Project
- New `ProperTea.Identity.Worker` console application
- Configured with OpenTelemetry and error handling
- Added to solution

### ✅ Implemented Outbox Pattern
- Added `OutboxMessages` table to `ProperTeaIdentityDbContext`
- Registered `IIntegrationEventPublisher` using outbox implementation
- Events are now stored in database before being published (transactional)

### ✅ Created Integration Event
- `UserCreatedIntegrationEvent` - published when user registers
- Contains: `UserId`, `Email`, `CreatedAt`
- Topic: `identity-events`

### ✅ Updated Registration Endpoint
- Now publishes `UserCreatedIntegrationEvent` to outbox
- Event stored in same transaction as user creation
- Guaranteed delivery via outbox pattern

### ✅ Created Outbox Processor Worker
- Background service that polls outbox table every 5 seconds
- Processes messages in batches (configurable)
- Uses `IntegrationEventsOutboxProcessor` for all logic
- Handles failures gracefully with retry logic

### ✅ Temporary No-Op Publisher
- `NoOpExternalIntegrationEventPublisher` for local development
- Logs events instead of publishing to message bus
- Ready to swap with RabbitMQ/Azure Service Bus implementation

## 🔧 Configuration

### Identity Worker - appsettings.json

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=propertea_identity;..."
  },
  "OutboxProcessor": {
    "PollingIntervalSeconds": 5,
    "BatchSize": 10
  },
  "OpenTelemetry": {
    "ServiceName": "ProperTea.Identity.Worker",
    "EnableTracing": true,
    "EnableMetrics": true,
    "EnableLogging": true
  }
}
```

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### Registration Flow

```
1. User POST /api/auth/register
2. Identity Service creates user in database
3. Identity Service publishes UserCreatedIntegrationEvent to outbox table
   (Both operations in same transaction - ACID guaranteed)
4. Returns 201 Created to user
   ↓
5. Worker polls outbox table every 5 seconds
6. Worker finds pending UserCreatedIntegrationEvent
7. Worker deserializes event
8. Worker publishes to NoOpPublisher (logs event)
9. Worker marks message as Published in outbox table
```

### Transactional Guarantees

- ✅ User creation and event publishing happen in same transaction
- ✅ Either both succeed or both fail (no partial state)
- ✅ Event guaranteed to be published at least once
- ✅ Worker retries failed messages automatically
- ✅ Failed messages are marked and can be investigated

## 📊 Integration Events Registration

### Fluent API Pattern

```csharp
builder.Services.AddProperIntegrationEvents(e =>
{
    e.AddEventType<UserCreatedIntegrationEvent>("UserCreated");
    // Add more event types as needed
})
.UseOutbox()
.UseEntityFrameworkStorage<ProperTeaIdentityDbContext>();
```

### What This Does

1. **AddProperIntegrationEvents** - Sets up event type resolver
2. **UseOutbox** - Enables outbox pattern, registers `IIntegrationEventsOutboxProcessor`
3. **UseEntityFrameworkStorage** - Registers EF-based outbox services:
   - `IIntegrationEventPublisher` → `OutboxIntegrationEventPublisher`
   - `IOutboxMessagesService` → `DbContextOutboxMessagesService`

---

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

### 1. Start Infrastructure

```bash
cd /home/oxface/repos/The-Supremacy/ProperTea
docker-compose -f docker-compose.infrastructure.yml up -d
```

### 2. Run Database Migration

```bash
cd services/Identity/ProperTea.Identity.Service
dotnet ef database update
```

### 3. Start Identity Service

```bash
cd services/Identity/ProperTea.Identity.Service
dotnet run
```

### 4. Start Identity Worker

```bash
cd services/Identity/ProperTea.Identity.Worker
dotnet run
```

### 5. Register a User

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "Test123!"
  }'
```

### 6. Check Worker Logs

You should see:
```
[Information] Outbox Processor Worker starting...
[Debug] Checking for pending outbox messages...
[Information] NoOp Publisher: Would publish event UserCreatedIntegrationEvent 
              to topic identity-events. EventId: {guid}
```

### 7. Verify Database

```sql
-- Check user was created
SELECT * FROM "AspNetUsers" WHERE "Email" = 'test@example.com';

-- Check outbox message
SELECT * FROM "OutboxMessages" WHERE "EventType" = 'UserCreated';
-- Should have Status = 'Published'
```

## 🔍 Key Implementation Details

### 1. Outbox Pattern

**Why?**
- Ensures events are published even if message bus is down
- Guarantees at-least-once delivery
- Decouples event publishing from business logic

**How?**
- Events stored in database table (same transaction as domain changes)
- Background worker polls table and publishes to message bus
- Messages marked as published after successful delivery

### 2. Event Type Resolver

**Purpose:** Maps event type strings to .NET types for deserialization

```csharp
// Registration
e.AddEventType<UserCreatedIntegrationEvent>("UserCreated");

// Usage in processor
var eventType = typeResolver.ResolveType("UserCreated");
// Returns typeof(UserCreatedIntegrationEvent)
```

### 3. Worker Pattern

- Uses `BackgroundService` from .NET
- Long-running process that polls continuously
- Graceful shutdown on cancellation token
- Creates scoped services for each batch (proper DI lifecycle)

## 📝 Database Migration

### Add Outbox Table

The migration adds the `OutboxMessages` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "OutboxMessages" (
    "Id" uuid NOT NULL,
    "EventType" text NOT NULL,
    "Topic" text NOT NULL,
    "Payload" text NOT NULL,
    "Status" text NOT NULL,
    "CreatedAt" timestamp NOT NULL,
    "PublishedAt" timestamp NULL,
    "RetryCount" integer NOT NULL,
    "LastError" text NULL,
    CONSTRAINT "PK_OutboxMessages" PRIMARY KEY ("Id")
);

CREATE INDEX "IX_OutboxMessages_Status_CreatedAt" 
ON "OutboxMessages" ("Status", "CreatedAt");
```

---

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### 1. Fluent API Design

The integration events registration uses a fluent builder pattern:
- `AddProperIntegrationEvents()` - Entry point
- `UseOutbox()` - Middleware/feature registration
- `UseEntityFrameworkStorage<T>()` - Implementation selection

This is extensible: could add `.UseRabbitMQ()`, `.UseServiceBus()`, etc.

### 2. Type Resolver Pattern

Events are registered by type name string for:
- Serialization/deserialization across services
- Version compatibility (can have multiple versions of same event)
- Language interoperability (could consume from non-.NET services)

### 3. Worker Service Pattern

Background workers should:
- Use `IServiceProvider` and create scopes (not inject scoped services)
- Handle exceptions gracefully (don't crash the worker)
- Respect cancellation tokens
- Log appropriately (Info for lifecycle, Debug for polling)

---

## 📊 Metrics to Monitor (Future)

When this goes to production, monitor:

- **Outbox lag** - Time between event creation and publication
- **Failure rate** - % of messages that fail
- **Retry count distribution** - How many messages need retries
- **Processing time** - How long does each batch take
- **Queue depth** - How many pending messages

---

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### OutboxProcessorOptions

| Property | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PollingIntervalSeconds` | 5 | How often to check for new messages |
| `BatchSize` | 10 | Max messages to process per batch |

**Tuning:**
- **High throughput:** Decrease interval, increase batch size
- **Low overhead:** Increase interval, decrease batch size
- **Development:** 2-5 seconds is fine
- **Production:** Start with 5 seconds, tune based on metrics

---

## ✅ Success Criteria - Met!

- ✅ Identity Worker project created and running
- ✅ Outbox table in database
- ✅ `UserCreatedIntegrationEvent` published on registration
- ✅ Worker processes outbox messages
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing endpoints
- ✅ All code compiles without errors
- ✅ Integration events infrastructure is reusable

---

## 🎉 Summary

**Identity Service refactoring is complete!** 

We successfully:
1. Added outbox pattern for reliable event publishing
2. Created worker service for background processing
3. Maintained backward compatibility
4. Set foundation for choreographed event-driven architecture

**The pattern is now proven and can be replicated in:**
- Contact Service
- Organization Service
- Permission Service
- All future services

**Next:** Build Contact Service (Week 2) to demonstrate service-to-service communication via events.
