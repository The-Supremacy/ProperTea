# 0005: Accessible Maintenance Terminology

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2026-01-22
**Deciders**: Development Team

## Context
"Errand" is a regional term that does not align with EU/UK industry standards. We need a tiered naming strategy that is professional for ERP reporting but accessible for technicians.

## Decision
Adopt **Work Order** as the primary domain aggregate. Implement the following UI labels:
* **Fault Report**: For reactive repairs.
* **Rounds**: For preventive/routine checks.
* **Property Inspection**: For move-in/out condition assessments.
* **Legal Audit**: For statutory/compliance safety checks.

## Consequences
### Positive
* Aligned with EU industry standards.
* Higher clarity for non-technical field staff.
