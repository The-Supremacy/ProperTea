# Developer Documentation

This folder contains technical guides, patterns, and explanations for quirky behaviors that developers and AI agents should know about.

## 📂 Contents

- **[theming-guide.md](./theming-guide.md)** - Complete guide for styling, colors, theming, and dynamic branding

## 🎯 Purpose

This folder documents:
- ✅ Non-obvious technical decisions
- ✅ Workarounds for framework quirks
- ✅ Patterns that prevent common mistakes
- ✅ "Why did we do it this way?" explanations
- ✅ Integration details between libraries

## 🤖 For AI Agents

When helping with frontend development:
1. Always reference [styling-colors-explained.md](./styling-colors-explained.md) for color decisions
2. Check [primeng-theme-quick-ref.md](./primeng-theme-quick-ref.md) for correct patterns
3. Don't use raw Tailwind colors without dark mode variants

## 📝 Adding New Documentation

When documenting quirky behavior:
- Create focused, single-topic documents
- Include code examples (good ✅ and bad ❌)
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Add links to official docs when relevant
- Update this README with a brief description
