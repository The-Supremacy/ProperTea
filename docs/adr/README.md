# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for ProperTea system. Each ADR documents a significant architectural decision, its context, and rationale.

## How to Use ADRs

ADRs follow a simple format:
- **Title**: Brief description of the decision
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The situation that led to this decision
- **Decision**: What we decided to do
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes of this decision

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:
1. Copy the template from `ADR-template.md`
2. Number sequentially (ADR-XXX)
3. Use descriptive titles
4. Fill in all sections thoughtfully
5. Get team review before marking as "Accepted"
6. Update this index

## Decision Review Process

1. **Propose**: Create ADR with "Proposed" status
2. **Discuss**: Review with team, capture feedback
3. **Decide**: Mark as "Accepted" when consensus reached
4. **Evolve**: Mark as "Superseded" when replaced, link to new ADR
